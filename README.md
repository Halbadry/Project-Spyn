# Project-Spyn
For class of fall 2023
project Spyn robot code pieces
The goal of the project was to simulate an autonomous vehicle picking up a handicapped person by building a robot using the 
Lego EV3 kit and writing software for it in MATLAB that would enable it to navigate a maze, pick up a cardboard cutout, and 
navigate to another section of the maze autonomously, while stopping at "red lights" marked by red colored squares.
Except for when a human driver controlled the robot enabling it to pick up and put down the cardboard cutout,
the robot autonomously navigated the maze, safely transporting the cardboard cutout to the opposite side.
